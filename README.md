# NY Taxi - Coding Challenge  

### Source Data
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) [publicly shares data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) on trips taken by Yellow taxis, Green taxis, and “For-Hire-Vehicles” (FHVs).

Please focus on trips taken by Yellow taxis in June 2017. 
You may find the Yellow taxi data dictionary and taxi zone lookup table helpful.

### Exercise
Imagine that you decide to drive a taxi for 10 hours each week to earn a little extra money. Explain how you would approach maximizing your income as a taxi driver.
If you could enrich the dataset, what would you add?  Is there anything in the dataset that you don’t find especially useful?
