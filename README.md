# NY Taxi - Coding Challenge  

### Source Data
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) [publicly shares data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) on trips taken by Yellow taxis, Green taxis, and “For-Hire-Vehicles” (FHVs).

Please focus on trips taken by Yellow taxis in June 2017. 
You may find the Yellow taxi data dictionary and taxi zone lookup table helpful.


### Fares 
[Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City)] 

As of September 4, 2012, fares begin at $2.50 ($3.00 between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 am, and $3.50 during the peak weekday hours of 4:00–8:00 p.m.) and increase based on the distance traveled and time spent in slow traffic (50 cents for each one-fifth of a mile or each 50 seconds stopped or traveling under 12 miles an hour).[33] An additional 50¢ tax is added to all trips within New York City. For trips to Nassau and Westchester counties, fare is the metered rate from the point of origin to the city limit, then twice the metered rate from the city limit to the destination. All trips between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport are charged a flat rate of $52. All trips to Newark Airport are charged the metered rate plus $17.50. The passenger also has to pay for any portion of the trip where the cab is driven on a toll road. The taxi must have an E-ZPass tag, and passengers pay the discounted E-ZPass toll rates.
### Exercise
Imagine that you decide to drive a taxi for 10 hours each week to earn a little extra money. Explain how you would approach maximizing your income as a taxi driver.
If you could enrich the dataset, what would you add?  Is there anything in the dataset that you don’t find especially useful?

## Results
